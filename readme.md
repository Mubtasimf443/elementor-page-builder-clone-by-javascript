# Elementor Page Builder Clone (JavaScript)

## 🛠️ Project Overview

This is a **JavaScript-based clone** of the popular **Elementor Page Builder** used in WordPress.  
It was created as a **student project** with the goal of building a simple yet functional web page builder—entirely using vanilla JavaScript.

Although the final result isn't as feature-rich as the official Elementor plugin, it lays a strong foundation and demonstrates key concepts of DOM manipulation, drag-and-drop components, and layout rendering.  
I built this in **just 7 days** as part of my learning journey. With more time (e.g., 30–60 days), I believe this project could evolve into something truly powerful.
